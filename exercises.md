### Questions 

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? 

I use a notebook to jot down ideas and thought processes

I often find my writing most aided when inspired through reading or watching a creative project i resonate with 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g, constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing) ?

There is somthing i the tangibility of a notebook that i find helpful when following my stream of consciousness although notebooks are less accessable and transferable than worting notes on my phone or throught the use of other technological devices 

My thoughts are often messy when they begin and so i find it helpful to write them down in an unfetted and chaotic process, somthing typing dulls for me 

When i am not putting in an effort to find creative influence through movies and books i am subsequently not finding my own creativity, therefore the work i produce does not come from within my own inspiration but that of influence. This can make my own work hinge on that of others, somthign i would like to move away from.
